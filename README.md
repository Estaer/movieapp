This page enables a user to search, filter and view all movies.

Movie data can be queried via [[theMovieDB]()] api.

Packages & Technologies used:
- `axios`
- `sass`
- `react-router-dom`

- Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
- Retrieve an `api key` from  [[theMovieDB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)]
